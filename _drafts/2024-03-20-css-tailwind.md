## Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is an open source CSS framework. The main feature of this library is that, unlike other CSS frameworks like Bootstrap, it does not provide a series of predefined classes for elements such as buttons or tables. Instead, it creates a list of "utility" CSS classes that can be used to style each element by mixing and matching.

For example, in other traditional systems, there would be a class message-warning that would apply a yellow background color and bold text. To achieve this result in Tailwind, one would have to apply a set of classes created by the library: `bg-yellow-300` and `font-bold`.
