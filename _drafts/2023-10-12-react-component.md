Components are one of the core concepts of React.
Components are the foundation upon which you build user interfaces (UI).

The `export default` prefix lets you mark the main function in a file so that you can later import it from other files. 

### root component
The React application begins at a “root” component. Usually, it is created automatically when you start a new project. For example, if you use CodeSandbox or if you use the framework Next.js, the root component is defined in pages/index.js.

### Defining a component
React components are regular JavaScript functions, but their names must start with a capital letter or they won’t work!

## React frameworks
If you want to build a new app or a new website fully with React, use frameworks. 

### Why Frameworks
If you just want to run React, then what you need just grab react and react-dom from npm. 
But as a Web App, it still need routing, data fetching, and generating HTML for good performance.
Frameworks provide features that most apps and sites eventually need, including routing, data fetching, and generating HTML.

### Next.js 
Next.js is a full-stack React framework.

### What is routing, data fetching, and generating HTML

### What is Network Waterfall.
Network Waterfall charts show what network requests are made when loading a web page. They are often used to analyze website speed and identify opportunities for optimization. Many DevTools provide Network Waterfall charts, Like Chrome DevTools.

It provides you with a visual representation of how all the assets on your website load. This includes CSS, JavaScript, HTML, images, plugins, and third-party content.
