## Premise

All production-grade React frameworks offer support for using TypeScript. Like, Next.js, Remix, Gatsby, Expo. 

When you want to write React app in TypeScript, you need to setup the configuration to support typeScript. For example, you need `ts-loader`, `source-map-loader`, `@types`, `tsconfig.json`, setup webpack config, etc.
For exmpale install the things: 
`npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader source-map-loader`
`npm install @types/react @types/react-dom`

The best way is using framework to build new project which support TypeScript. Otherwise you will have a big head.

Of course you will use TSX, TS files instead of JS files.

## TypeScript and Components

{: .block-warning}

Writing TypeScript with React is very similar to writing JavaScript with React. The key difference when working with a component is that you can **provide types for your component’s props**. These types can be used for correctness checking and providing inline documentation in editors.

```js
function MyButton({ title }: { title: string }) {
  return (
    <button>{title}</button>
  );
}

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton title="I'm a button" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

inline syntax is the simplest way to provide types for a component, though once you start to have a few fields to describe it can become unwieldy. Instead, you can use an interface or type to describe the component’s props

```js
interface MyButtonProps {
  /** The text to display inside the button */
  title: string;
  /** Whether the button can be interacted with */
  disabled: boolean;
}

function MyButton({ title, disabled }: MyButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button disabled={disabled}>{title}</button>
  );
}

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton title="I'm a disabled button" disabled={true}/>
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Hooks and TypeScript

The type definitions from `@types/react` include types for the built-in Hooks, so you can use them in your components without any additional setup. They are built to take into account the code you write in your component, so you will get **inferred types** a lot of the time.

### useState

infer types:
```js
// Infer the type as "boolean"
const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(false);
```
But you still can do it explicitly:
```ts
// Explicitly set the type to "boolean"
const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState<boolean>(false);
```

### useReducer

Exampel:
```ts
import {useReducer} from 'react';

interface State {
   count: number 
};
type CounterAction =
  | { type: "reset" }
  | { type: "setCount"; value: State["count"] };
const initialState: State = { count: 0 };
function stateReducer(state: State, action: CounterAction): State {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "reset":
      return initialState;
    case "setCount":
      return { ...state, count: action.value };
    default:
      throw new Error("Unknown action");
  }
}

export default function App() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(stateReducer, initialState);
  const addFive = () => dispatch({ type: "setCount", value: state.count + 5 });
  const reset = () => dispatch({ type: "reset" });
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my counter</h1>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={addFive}>Add 5</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
We are using TypeScript in a few key places:

- `interface State` describes the shape of the reducer’s state.
- `type CounterAction` describes the different actions which can be dispatched to the reducer.
- `const initialState: State` provides a type for the initial state, and also the type which is used by useReducer by default.
- `stateReducer(state: State, action: CounterAction): State` sets the types for the reducer function’s arguments and return value.

### useContext
### useMemo
### useCallback

## Useful Types 

### DOM Events 
When working with DOM events in React, the type of the event can often be inferred from the event handler. However, when you want to extract a function to be passed to an event handler, you will need to **explicitly** set the type of the event.

```ts
export default function Form() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("Change me");

  function handleChange(event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    setValue(event.currentTarget.value);
  }
  return (
    <>
      <input value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
      <p>Value: {value}</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Children 

There are two common paths to describing the children of a component. The first is to use the `React.ReactNode` type, which is a union of all the possible types that can be passed as children in JSX:
```ts
interface ModalRendererProps {
  title: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}
```
This is a very broad definition of children. The second is to use the `React.ReactElement` type, which is only JSX elements and not JavaScript primitives like strings or numbers:
```ts
interface ModalRendererProps {
  title: string;
  children: React.ReactElement;
}
```

> Note, that you cannot use TypeScript to describe that the children are a certain type of JSX elements, so you cannot use the type-system to describe a component which only accepts `<li>` children.

### Style Props

When using inline styles in React, you can use `React.CSSProperties` to describe the object passed to the style prop. This type is a union of all the possible CSS properties, and is a good way to ensure you are passing valid CSS properties to the style prop, and to get auto-complete in your editor.

```ts
interface MyComponentProps {
  style: React.CSSProperties;
}
```
### React.ComponentProps

When you component wrap basic elements, like div, button, you can use `React.ComponentProps` accept all the props for that elements. 

```ts
import { ComponentProps } from "react";
type MyDivProps = ComponentProps<"div"> & {
  myProp: string;
};
const MyDiv = ({ myProp, ...props }: MyDivProps) => {
  console.log(myProp!);
  return <div {...props} />;
};
```

There are also `ComponentPropsWithRef`,  `ComponentPropsWithoutRef` available.

## Manage Types
The more type information provided to TypeScript, the more powerful its type checking is. 

### Naming Conventions

- Use `PascalCase` for type names.
- Do not use the `I` prefix for interfaces. (Something that was copied from statically typed languages)
- Use `_` prefix for private properties.
- Use consistent naming for component props types (For example, type CustomComponentProps)

### Where To Put Your Types in Application Code

- Rule 1: When a type is used in only one place, put it in the same file where it's used.
```ts
interface Props {
  foo: string
  bar: number
}
export const MyComponent = (props: Props) => {
  // ...
}
```
And when types are truly single-use, You can even inline them:
```ts
export const MyComponent = (props: {foo: string; bar: number}) => {
  // ...
}
```

- Rule 2: Types that are used in more than one place should be moved to a shared location.
```
|- src
  |- components
    |- MyComponent.tsx
  |- shared.types.ts
```
If they're only used in the components folder, I'll put them there:
```
|- src
  |- components-
    |- MyComponent.tsx
    |- components.types.ts
```
In other words, I share the type across the smallest number of modules that need it.

- Rule 3: Types that are used in more than one package in a monorepo should be moved to a shared package.
if you're working on a monorepo with multiple packages?
In that case, you should move shared types to a shared package.
```
|- apps
  |- app
  |- website
  |- docs
|- packages
  |- types
    |- src
      |- shared.types.ts
```

### export import types

types.ts file:
```ts
export type Launch = {
  id: string;
  full_name: string;
};
```
you can use `import` or `import type`:
```ts
import type {Launch} from './types';
```

### Namespaces
As your project size increases, so will the number of types. There is a good chance that there will be name collisions. Namespaces are the solution to this problem. A namespace will not only avoid multiple type declarations but also provide an organisational structure to your projects. Using namespaces effectively can make your codebase clean. 

### Keyof, Typeof

In Typescript, it can use the `typeof` operator to get the exact type definition of a variable. `typeof` can be used to infer types.
 
The `keyof` operator is introduced by typescript. It gives the properties of an object type in form of a union. For example:
```ts
type X = {a: number; b: boolean;};
const x: X = {a: 1, b: false};
// Y = 'a' | 'b'
type Y = keyof X;
const y: Y = 'a';
/* Without explicitly specifying y as type Y TS will infer its type as string and will throw an error about indexing type X using string */
console.log(x[y]);
```

You will often be using typeof and keyof operators in combination, typeof to get the type of an object and keyof to index it.

### Project scope types (@types)

`@types` is a special directory in typescript. The declaration file (*.d.ts files, e.g. index.d.ts) are auto recognised by your project’s tsconfig as the root types files. The types defined in these files can be used as global types in your project.

There will be times when certain type definitions will be required frequently. `@types` is the answer to this. You can use `@types` to overwrite or extend your type definitions.

Here is an example of @types/index.d.ts:
```ts
namespace React {
  type ClassicFunctionComponent<T = {}> = React.FC<{children?: React.ReactNode} & T>;
  type CFC<T = {}> = ClassicFunctionComponent<T>;

  /* Shorthand for React.ForwardRefRenderFunction */
  type FRF<T, P = {}> = React.ForwardRefRenderFunction<T, P>;
}

type Optional<Type, Key extends keyof Type> = Omit<Type, Key> & Partial<Pick<Type, Key>>;

namespace Api {
  type ResponseBody<T = {}> = {
    message: string;
    data: T;
    success: boolean;
  };
 
  type RB<T = any> = ResponseBody<T>;
}
```

### Utility Types

Typescript provides several utility types which help you transform your type definitions. Some of my commonly used utility types are:

- Partial<Type> constructs type with all the properties of the type set to optional.
```ts
type X = {a: number;}
// Y = Partial<X> = {a?: number;} or {a: number | undefined;}
type Y = Partial<X>
```

- Required<Type> constructs type with all the properties of the type set to required.
```ts
type X = {a?: number;}
// Y = Required<X> = {a: number;}
type Y = Required<X>
```

- Record<Keys, Type> constructs an object type with property key of type Keys and property value of type Type.
```ts
// X = {[key: string]: number;}
type X = Record<string, number>
```

- Omit<Type, Keys> constructs a type from type Type after removing key Keys (string literal or union of strings).
```ts
type X = {a: number; b: boolean; c: string;}
// Y = {b: boolean; c: string;}
type Y = Omit<X, 'a'>
// Z = {c: string;}
type Z = Omit<X, 'a' | 'b'>
```
There are many more Utility Types in typescript and these will help you avoid rewriting your type definitions for every individual or derivable type.

You can also write custom utility types, like the Optional type provided in the `@types/index.d.ts` file. Optional type is used to make only selected properties optional in a type.

### Generics

Generics take type(s) as input and use them to derive the type of variables or functions. One of the examples is the utility type Partial`<T>`, which takes type T as input and gives a new type. Generics can take more than one type as input and can also have default types. Here is an example of generics with function.

```ts
/* Type is passed to the function either explicitly or implicitly */
function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}
/* Explicitly: Type is assigned type string explicitly and the function takes string argument arg */
identity<string>("Hello");
/* Implicitly: Type implicitly takes type string based on the type of argument arg */
identity("World")
```

Use generics to make your code reusable without writing multiple type definitions.
