## Styling

### add a global CSS file 

You can import `global.css` in any component in your application, but it's usually good practice to add it to your top-level component. In Next.js, this is the root layout.

### Tailwind
Tailwind is a CSS framework that speeds up the development process by allowing you to quickly write utility classes directly in your TSX markup. Next support Tailwind natively.

### CSS Modules

```ts
import styles from '@/app/ui/home.module.css';
<div className={styles.shape} />;
```

### Using the clsx library to toggle class names

- Suppose that you want to create an InvoiceStatus component which accepts status. The status can be 'pending' or 'paid'.
- If it's 'paid', you want the color to be green. If it's 'pending', you want the color to be gray.
You can use clsx to conditionally apply the classes, like this:

```ts
import clsx from 'clsx';
 
export default function InvoiceStatus({ status }: { status: string }) {
  return (
    <span
      className={clsx(
        'inline-flex items-center rounded-full px-2 py-1 text-sm',
        {
          'bg-gray-100 text-gray-500': status === 'pending',
          'bg-green-500 text-white': status === 'paid',
        },
      )}
    >
    // ...
)}
```

### Other styling solutions

You can also style your Next.js application with:

- **Sass** which allows you to import `.css` and `.scss` files.
- **CSS-in-JS** libraries such as `styled-jsx`, `styled-components`, and `emotion`.

## Optimizing Fonts and Images

### Fonts

Next.js **downloads** font files at build time and hosts them with your other static assets. This means when a user visits your application, there are no additional network requests for fonts which would impact performance.

Next.js do this to download font:
/app/ui/fonts.ts
```ts
import { Inter } from 'next/font/google';
 
export const inter = Inter({ subsets: ['latin'] });
```

/app/layout.tsx
```ts
import '@/app/ui/global.css';
import { inter } from '@/app/ui/fonts';
 
export default function RootLayout({
  children,
}: {
  children: React.ReactNode;
}) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body className={`${inter.className} antialiased`}>{children}</body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

### Images

The `<Image>` Component is an extension of the HTML `<img>` tag, and comes with automatic image optimization, such as:

- Preventing layout shift automatically when images are loading.
- Resizing images to avoid shipping large images to devices with a smaller viewport.
- Lazy loading images by default (images load as they enter the viewport).
- Serving images in modern formats, like WebP and AVIF, when the browser supports it.

## Layouts and Pages

Next.js uses **file-system routing** where folders are used to create nested routes. Each folder represents a route segment that maps to a URL segment.

You can create separate UIs for each route using `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` files.

- `page.tsx` is a special Next.js file that exports a React component, and it's required for the route to be accessible. Only the content inside the page file will be publicly accessible. 

- You can use a special `layout.tsx` file to create UI that is shared between multiple pages.
