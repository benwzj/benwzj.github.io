Now the people begin talk about dropping TypeScript. Why?

The main reasons looks like this:

> Not just because it requires an explicit compile step, but because it pollutes the code with type gymnastics that add ever so little joy to my development experience, and quite frequently considerable grief. Things that should be easy become hard, and things that are hard become `any`.

One of the longest running schisms in programming is that of static vs dynamic typing. I've heard a million arguments from both sides throughout my entire career, but seen very few of them ever convinced anyone of anything. As rationalizations masquerading as reason rarely do in matters of faith. 

many people answer question why you use TS, they usually saying I can use inferface, I can use generic to make reuseful functions. Are them your reasons?


Let us enjoy JavaScript in the glorious spirit it was originally designed: Free of strong typing.
