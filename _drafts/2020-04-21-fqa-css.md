### why height : 50% is not working? 
need to do following first: 
body {
height: 100vh; 
}

### what is vh? 
Viewport-percentage Height, also , we have vw, vmin, vmax
vh unit, equal to 1% of the height of initial containing block. 
or use height: 50vh, it is working! 
They are working well elegantly!

### What is min-height?
this property set the minimum height.
