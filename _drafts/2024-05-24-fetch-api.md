## Fetch API

The Fetch API provides a JavaScript interface for making HTTP requests and processing the responses.

Fetch is the modern replacement for `XMLHttpRequest`: unlike `XMLHttpRequest`, which uses callbacks, Fetch is promise-based and is integrated with features of the modern web such as service workers and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).

### Using the Fetch API Steps
- Make a request by calling `fetch()`.
- pass it a `Request` object or a string containing the URL to fetch, along with an optional argument to configure the request.
- The `fetch()` function returns a `Promise` which is fulfilled with a `Response` object representing the server's response. 
- You can then check the request status and extract the body of the response in various formats, including text and JSON, by calling the appropriate method on the response.

The minimal example:
```js
async function getData() {
  const url = "https://example.org/products.json";
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error(`Response status: ${response.status}`);
    }

    const json = await response.json();
    console.log(json);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error.message);
  }
}
```

### Making a request
#### Setting a body
The request body is the payload of the request: it's the thing the client is sending to the server.
You don't need a body with `GET` requests, but it's useful for requests that send content to the server, such as `POST` or `PUT` requests.

```js
const response = await fetch("https://example.org/post", {
  method: "POST",
  body: JSON.stringify({ username: "example" }),
  // ...
});
```
`body` can be a string or ArrayBuffer, TypedArray etc.

#### Setting headers
Request headers give the server information about the request: for example, the `Content-Type` header tells the server the format of the request's body.
You can pass an object literal here containing `header-name: header-value` properties.
```js
const response = await fetch("https://example.org/post", {
  headers: {
    "Content-Type": "application/json",
    'X-Shopify-Storefront-Access-Token': 'key-eikdjsa;je;fmdjasiopej4f4t3g324r4',
  },
  // .,.
});
```
#### Making cross-origin requests
`mode` option, three values: cors, no-cors, or same-origin.

By default, `mode` is set to `cors`, meaning that if the request is cross-origin then it will use the **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) mechanism**. 
There are two kinds requests:
- **simple request**: the request will always be sent, but the server must respond with the correct `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header or the browser will not share the response with the caller.
- **preflighted request**: browser will send a preflighted request to check that the server understands CORS and allows the request, and the real request will not be sent unless the server responds to the preflighted request with the appropriate CORS headers.

Setting `mode` to `same-origin` disallows cross-origin requests completely.
Setting `mode` to `no-cors` means the request must be a simple request, which restricts the headers that may be set, and restricts methods to GET, HEAD, and POST.

### Reading response 
Request and response bodies are actually `ReadableStream` objects, and whenever you read them, you're streaming the content. This is good for memory efficiency, because the browser doesn't have to buffer the entire response in memory before the caller retrieves it using a method like `json()`.

Reading the response body methods: 
```js
Response.arrayBuffer()
Response.blob()
Response.formData()
Response.json()
Response.text()
```
You can read status, type, headers as well.

## Fetch vs Axios

### What is Axios

Axios is a third-party library, a promise-based third-party HTTP client library for the browser and Node.js. 
It provides an easy-to-use API and offers features such as making asynchronous requests, handling request and response interception, and automatic transformation of JSON data.

### Sending a GET Request with Query Parameters:
```js
// Axios
axios.get('/api/data', {
  params: {
    name: 'Alice',
    age: 25
  }
})
.then(response => {
  // handle response
})
.catch(error => {
  // handle error
});

// Fetch
const url = new URL('/api/data');
url.searchParams.append('name', 'Alice');
url.searchParams.append('age', 25);

fetch(url)
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  // handle data
})
.catch(error => {
  // handle error
});
```

### Sending a POST Request with a JSON Body
```js
// Axios
axios.post('/api/data', {
  name: 'Bob',
  age: 30
})
.then(response => {
  // handle response
})
.catch(error => {
  // handle error
});

// Fetch
fetch('/api/data', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    name: 'Bob',
    age: 30
  })
})
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  // handle data
})
.catch(error => {
  // handle error
});
```

### Setting a Timeout for the Request:
```js
// Axios
axios.get('/api/data', {
  timeout: 5000 // 5 seconds
})
.then(response => {
  // handle response
})
.catch(error => {
  // handle error
});

// Fetch
const controller = new AbortController();
const signal = controller.signal;

setTimeout(() => {
  controller.abort(); // abort after 5 seconds
}, 5000);

fetch('/api/data', { signal })
.then(response => response.json())
.then(data => {
  // handle data
})
.catch(error => {
  // handle error
});
```

### Error Handling

#### Axios:
In Axios, if there is a request failure, it throws an error and you can easily handle the error with a try-catch block and get the error data from `error.response.data`. For example:
```js
// Axios error handling with try-catch
try {
  const response = await axios.get('/api/data');
  // handle response
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
  console.log(error.response.data);
}
```

#### Fetch:
In Fetch, if there is a request failure, it does not throw an error, but returns a response object with an ok property set to false. You have to check the ok property and throw an error manually if you want to use a try-catch block.

Alternatively, you can use the response.ok property to handle different cases in the then method. For example:
```js
// Fetch error handling with try-catch
try {
  const response = await fetch('/api/data');
  // check response status
  if (!response.ok) {
    // throw error if status is not ok
    throw new Error(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
  }
  // handle response
} catch (error) {
  // handle error
  console.log(error.message);
}

// Fetch error handling with response.ok
fetch('/api/data')
  .then(response => {
    // check response status
    if (response.ok) {
      // handle response
    } else {
      // handle error
      console.log(`HTTP error! status: ${response.status}`);
    }
  })
  .catch(error => {
    // handle network error
    console.log(error.message);
  });
```

### Using async/await syntax:
```js
// Axios
async function getData() {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get('/api/data');
    // handle response
  } catch (error) {
    // handle error
  }
}

// Fetch
async function getData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch('/api/data');
    const data = await response.json();
    // handle data
  } catch (error) {
    // handle error
  }
}
```
### Compatibility

Axios:
- Axios is a third-party library that needs to be installed and included in your project.
- It supports older browsers by including polyfills for promises and other modern JavaScript features.
- Axios is actively maintained and keeps up with the latest browser and Node.js updates, ensuring compatibility with new environments.
- However, since it's a separate library, you need to ensure that you're using a compatible version with your project dependencies.

Fetch:
- The Fetch API is a native Web API supported by modern browsers.
- It has excellent support in recent browser versions, but older browsers (such as Internet Explorer) do not support it natively.
- If you need to support older browsers, you'll need to include a polyfill or use a fallback solution (e.g., XMLHttpRequest).
- Since it's a native API, it's automatically updated and maintained by browser vendors, ensuring compatibility with future browser versions.

### handle non-200 status codes
Another difference between Fetch and Axios is how they handle non-200 status codes. Axios considers any status code outside the range of 2xx as an error and rejects the promise. Fetch considers any valid HTTP response (even 4xx or 5xx) as a success and resolves the promise.
This means that you have to handle non-200 status codes differently in Fetch and Axios.

## Next.js extends fetch

### Fetching Data on the Server with `fetch`

Next.js **extends** the native `fetch` Web API to allow you to configure the caching and revalidating behavior for each fetch request on the server. So you don't need to worry fetch data many time or in many places.

React extends `fetch` to automatically memoize fetch requests while rendering a React component tree.

You can use `fetch` with `async/await` in Server Components, in Route Handlers, and in Server Actions.
