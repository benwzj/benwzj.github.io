## How Google Search works

### Crawling: 
- Google downloads text, images, and videos from pages it found on the internet with automated programs called crawlers.
- Google constantly look for new and updated pages and add them to its list of known pages. This process is called "URL discovery".
- During the crawl, Google renders the page and runs any JavaScript it finds using a recent version of Chrome, similar to how your browser renders pages you visit.
- Crawling depends on whether Google's crawlers can access the site. For example, `robots.txt` rules preventing Googlebot's access to the page.

### Indexing: 
- After a page is crawled, Google tries to understand what the page is about. This stage is called indexing and it includes processing and analyzing the textual content and key content tags and attributes, such as `<title>` elements and `alt` attributes, `images`, `videos`, and more. And stores the information in the Google index.
- During the indexing process, Google determines if a page is a duplicate of another page on the internet or **canonical**.  
- Indexing also depends on the **content** of the page and its **metadata**.

### Serving search results: 
- When a user enters a query, our machines search the index for matching pages and return the results we believe are the highest quality and most relevant to the user's query. 
- Search Console might tell you that a page is indexed, but you don't see it in search results. Check it.

## Control how Google crawls and indexes

a canonical URL is the URL of a page that Google chose as the most representative from a set of duplicate pages.
