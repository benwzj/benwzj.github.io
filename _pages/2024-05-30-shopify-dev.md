### What is Point of Sale (POS)

The point of sale (POS) is the time and place at which a retail transaction is completed. At the point of sale, the merchant calculates the amount owed by the customer, indicates that amount, prepare an invoice for the customer (which may be a cash register printout), and indicates the options for the customer to make payment.

### What is Shopify Point of Sale (POS)

Shopify POS is a point of sale **app** that you can use to sell your products in person. 
Process orders, accept payments, produce receipts, and control it all from your mobile device. Shopify online store automatically synchronizes with Shopify POS, and you manage your entire business from one dashboard. Inventory, product, and payment updates that you make in your Shopify admin will instantly take effect in Shopify POS.

### What is App extension

- An app extension enables you to add your app's functionality to Shopify user interfaces.
- An app extension isnâ€™t an app. It's a mechanism that lets an app add features to certain defined parts of several Shopify user interfaces
- **Without** an app extension, users interact directly with your app. Your app relays information to Shopify that gets surfaced back to the users through your app.
- **With** an app extension, users interact with Shopify. Shopify relays information to your app that gets surfaced back to the users through your app extension in Shopify.
