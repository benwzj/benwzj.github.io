Hey, I'm Ben! Welcome to my place on the web for my life, works, projects, sports and anything else I want to show the world.

Check out the Blog page for my IT notes and tutorials, and the projects page to see a highlight of my open-source work.

My site has no ads, no affiliate links, no tracking or analytics, no sponsored posts, and no paywall. Just a place for myself to review, refresh, renew the skill, technique, knowledge of my life and work.
