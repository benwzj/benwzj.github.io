## Main Points

- TS is **SuperSet** of JS.
- TS is JS with syntax for types.
- TS need to be compiled.
- You can say TS is a compiler, can replace Babel.
- The main point of TS compiler is providing Type Check.
- TS provide more semantics.
- TS have a big community.
- TS is known as an Object-oriented programming language whereas JS is a prototype-based language.
- TypeScript introduces a type system to JavaScript, enabling developers to catch errors at compile-time rather than runtime. 

## Key Features

- Static Typing: TypeScript allows developers to explicitly define types for variables, function parameters, and return values. This helps in detecting errors and providing better tooling support.
- Type Inference: TypeScript can infer types based on the values assigned to variables, reducing the need for explicit type annotations.
- Enhanced IDE Support: TypeScript provides better autocompletion, code navigation, and refactoring capabilities in modern IDEs.
- ECMAScript Compatibility: TypeScript is designed to be a superset of JavaScript, meaning that any valid JavaScript code is also valid TypeScript code.
- Compiler and Language Features: TypeScript has its own compiler, which transpiles TypeScript code to plain JavaScript. It also includes additional language features like interfaces, classes, modules, and more, which are not natively available in JavaScript.
- Benefit
  - Good for large project. 
  - Refactoring
  - Code completion
  - Static typing
  - Shorthand notations

## Type System

TypeScript is **Structural Type System**.

One of TypeScript’s core principles is that type checking focuses on the shape that values have.

> In a structural type system, if two objects have the same shape, they are considered to be of the same type.

Interface vs type alias is always a topic for better understanding of TS typs system.

Normally, TypeScript will generate types for you in many cases. 
For example in creating a variable and assigning it to a particular value, TypeScript will use the value as its type.
```ts
let helloWorld = "Hello World";
let helloWorld: string
```

But types can be more complicated than that. For example, some design patterns make it difficult for types to be inferred automatically. So TS provide a list of ways to solve them.

### TS provide ways to describe types of JS

- For Primitive types, like string, number, boolean, BigInt, Symbol, null and undefined, each has a corresponding type in TypeScript. 
- To specify the type of an array like [1, 2, 3], you can use the syntax `number[]`. It is same with `Array<number>`.
- Can and should Type Annotations on Variables.
- Using `any` whenever you don’t want a particular value to cause typechecking errors.
- Can specify the types of both the input and output values of functions.
- Define an object type, we simply list its properties and their types. And it support Optional Properties.
- Union Types.
- **Type Aliases** provide a easier way to manage types. 
- **Interface declaration** is another way to name an object type.
- Using **Type Assertion** to specify a more specific type.
- Provide Literal Types which is usful in Union types.
- Add **Enums** feature.

## Type Alias

With TypeScript, you can create complex types by **combining** simple ones. There are two popular ways to do so: with **unions**, and with **generics**.
Types Alias make all these convenient to manage.

### Describe Union
A popular use-case for union types is to describe the set of string or number literals that a value is allowed to be:
```ts
type WindowStates = "open" | "closed" | "minimized";
type LockStates = "locked" | "unlocked";
type PositiveOddNumbersUnderTen = 1 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 9;
```

### Describe Tuple
```ts
type Address = [Number, String];
const address: Address = [1, "27 haha st"];
```

### Describe Utility Types

```ts
interface Todo {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  completed: boolean;
  createdAt: number;
}
 
type TodoPreview = Omit<Todo, "description">;
```

### Extract type from other 

```ts
const project = {
  title: "project 1";
  specification: {
    areaSize: 100;
    rooms: 3;
  }
}
type Spec = typeof project["spectification"];

```

### Describe Generic
Generics provide variables to types by using `<>` angle bracket. 

A common example is an array. An array without generics could contain anything. An array with generics can describe the values that the array contains.
For example: 
```ts
type StringArray = Array<string>;
type NumberArray = Array<number>;
type ObjectWithNameArray = Array<{ name: string }>;
```

You can declare your own types that use generics:
``` ts
interface Backpack<Type> {
  add: (obj: Type) => void;
  get: () => Type;
}

// This line is a shortcut to tell TypeScript there is a
// constant called `backpack`, and to not worry about where it came from.
declare const backpack: Backpack<string>;
 
// object is a string, because we declared it above as the variable part of Backpack.
const object = backpack.get();
 
// Since the backpack variable is a string, you can't pass a number to the add function.
backpack.add(23); // error: Argument of type 'number' is not assignable to parameter of type 'string'
```

## Interface

Interface is powerful in object. You can explicitly describe this object’s shape using an interface declaration.

Define an interface:
```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  id: number;
}
```

Now, you can declare that a JavaScript object conforms to the shape of your new interface by using syntax like : TypeName after a variable declaration:
```ts
const user: User = {
  name: "Hayes",
  id: 0,
};
```

Since JavaScript supports classes and object-oriented programming, so does TypeScript. You can use an interface declaration with classes:
```ts
interface User {
  name: string;
  id: number;
}
 
class UserAccount {
  name: string;
  id: number;
 
  constructor(name: string, id: number) {
    this.name = name;
    this.id = id;
  }
}
 
const user: User = new UserAccount("Murphy", 1);
```

You can use interfaces to annotate parameters and return values to functions:
```ts
function deleteUser(user: User) {
  // ...
}
 
function getAdminUser(): User {
  //...
}
```

There is already 7 primitive types available in JavaScript which you can use in an interface. TypeScript extends this list with a few more, such as **any** (allow anything), **unknown** (ensure someone using this type declares what the type is), **never** (it’s not possible that this type could happen), and **void** (a function which returns undefined or has no return value).

## interfaces vs type aliases

There are two main tools to declare the shape of an object: interfaces and type aliases.

They are very similar, and for the most common cases act the same. And because TypeScript is a structural type system, it's possible to intermix their use.

Almost all features of an interface are available in type, the key distinction is that a type cannot be re-opened to add new properties vs an interface which is always extendable.

Only Type Alias can be used to alias a primitive. Interface only support object.

Type Alias is alias, and Interface is declaration.

### Both support extending
Type aliases do this via intersection types, while interfaces have a keyword.

```ts
type BirdType = {
  wings: 2;
};

interface BirdInterface {
  wings: 2;
}
type Owl = { nocturnal: true } & BirdType;
type Robin = { nocturnal: false } & BirdInterface;

interface Peacock extends BirdType {
  colourful: true;
  flies: false;
}
interface Chicken extends BirdInterface {
  colourful: false;
  flies: false;
}

let owl: Owl = { wings: 2, nocturnal: true };
let chicken: Chicken = { wings: 2, colourful: false, flies: false };
```

But TypeScript recommend to use interfaces over type aliases. Specifically, because you will get better error messages. 

### interfaces are open and type aliases are closed. 
This means you can extend an interface by declaring it a second time. 

```ts
interface Kitten {
  purrs: boolean;
}

interface Kitten {
  colour: string;
}
```

For publicly exposed types, it's a better call to make them an interface.
But, I have to say, close is better than open.

## Generics

Why Generics in TypeScript?

TypeScripte copy this concept from Java and C#, which make it possible to create a component that can work over a variety of types rather than a single one. This allows users to consume these components and use their own types.

- Definiton: 
Generics take type(s) as input and use them to derive the type of variables or functions.

- Purpose: 
Generics type give you chance to describe the type **relationship** between input and output.

### Generic function

```ts
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}
/* Explicitly*/
identity<string>("Hello");
/* Implicitly */
identity("World") // the compiler just looked at the value "World", and set Type to its type.
```

### Generic Types

The type of the Generic Function: 
```ts
function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}

let myIdentity: <Type>(arg: Type) => Type = identity;
```
Now you can get it: `<Type>(arg: Type) => Type` is the type of the function.

We can also write the generic type as a call signature of an object literal type:
```ts
function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}
 
let myIdentity: { <Type>(arg: Type): Type } = identity;
```

We can wrap it up into a interface:
```ts
interface GenericIdentityFn {
  <Type>(arg: Type): Type;
}
```

Now, we may want to move the generic parameter to be a parameter of the whole interface. This lets us see what type(s) we’re generic over (e.g. `Dictionary<string>` rather than just `Dictionary`). This makes the type parameter visible to all the other members of the interface.

```ts
interface GenericIdentityFn<Type> {
  (arg: Type): Type;
}
 
function identity<Type>(arg: Type): Type {
  return arg;
}
 
let myIdentity: GenericIdentityFn<number> = identity;
```

Instead of describing a generic function, we now have a non-generic function signature (`(arg: Type): Type`) that is a part of a **generic type** (`GenericIdentityFn<Type>`). 

When we use `GenericIdentityFn`, we now will also need to specify the corresponding type argument (here: `number`), effectively locking in what the underlying call signature will use.

> Understanding when to put the type parameter directly on the call signature and when to put it on the interface itself will be helpful in describing what aspects of a type are generic.

## Declaration files 

`.d.ts` files are called type declaration files. They exist for one purpose only: to describe the shape of an existing module and they only contain type information used for type checking.
