## What is Function Calling

Function calling lets you connect models to external tools and APIs. Instead of generating text responses, the model understands when to call specific functions and provides the necessary parameters to execute real-world actions. This allows the model to act as a bridge between natural language and real-world actions and data. Function calling has 3 primary use cases:

- Augment Knowledge: Access information from external sources like databases, APIs, and knowledge bases.
- Extend Capabilities: Use external tools to perform computations and extend the limitations of the model, such as using a calculator or creating charts.
- Take Actions: Interact with external systems using APIs, such as scheduling appointments, creating invoices, sending emails, or controlling smart home devices
