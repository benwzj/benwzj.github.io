Embeddings is the basic key point to understand Machine Learning. And it is Machine Learning's Most Useful Multitool.

In machine learning, an embedding is a way of representing data as points in n-dimensional space so that similar data points cluster together. 
The machine can understand things because of embedding.

## What are Embeddings

Embeddings are a way of representing data–almost any kind of data, like text, images, videos, users, music, whatever–as points in space where the locations of those points in space are semantically meaningful.

Abstractively, embeddings allow us to find similar data points. 
Realistically, embeddings store semantically meaning in arrays of number.

What kinds of things can be embedded? All The Things! Text, Images, Videos, Music.

## Embedding models

- Word2Vec (short for word to vector) was a technique invented by Google in 2013 for embedding words.
