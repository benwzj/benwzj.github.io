## Overview

- All React frameworks offer support for using TypeScript. Like, Next.js, Remix, Gatsby, Expo, Create-React-App.
- When you want to write React app in TypeScript, you need to setup the configuration to support typeScript. For example, you need `ts-loader`, `source-map-loader`, `@types`, `tsconfig.json`, setup webpack config, etc.
- The things you need can be: 
`npm install --save-dev typescript ts-loader source-map-loader`, 
`npm install @types/react @types/react-dom` etc.
- The best way is **using framework** to build new project which support TypeScript. Otherwise you will have a big head.
- When you are changing your project from JS to TS, it is recommend to use framework to start a new project. You don't need to care so many setup.
- You will use `tsx` and `ts` files instead of `js` files.

## Component and TypeScript

> Every file containing JSX must use the `.tsx` file extension. This is a TypeScript-specific extension that tells TypeScript that this file contains JSX.

Writing TypeScript with React is very similar to writing JavaScript with React. The key difference when working with a component is that you can provide types for your component’s props. These types can be used for correctness checking and providing inline documentation in editors.

### Prop Type Example

```js
function MyButton({ title }: { title: string }) {
  return (
    <button>{title}</button>
  );
}

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton title="I'm a button" />
    </div>
  );
}
```

Inline syntax is the simplest way to provide types for a component, though once you start to have a few fields to describe it can become unwieldy. Instead, you can use an interface or type to describe the component’s props.

```js
interface MyButtonProps {
  /** The text to display inside the button */
  title: string;
  /** Whether the button can be interacted with */
  disabled: boolean;
}

function MyButton({ title, disabled }: MyButtonProps) {
  return (
    <button disabled={disabled}>{title}</button>
  );
}

export default function MyApp() {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my app</h1>
      <MyButton title="I'm a disabled button" disabled={true}/>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Basic Prop Types

A list of TypeScript types you will likely use in a React+TypeScript app:
```ts
type AppProps = {
  message: string;
  count: number;
  disabled: boolean;
  /** array of a type! */
  names: string[];
  /** string literals to specify exact string values, with a union type to join them together */
  status: "waiting" | "success";
  /** an object with known properties (but could have more at runtime) */
  obj: {
    id: string;
    title: string;
  };
  /** array of objects! (common) */
  objArr: {
    id: string;
    title: string;
  }[];
  /** any non-primitive value - can't access any properties (NOT COMMON but useful as placeholder) */
  obj2: object;
  /** an interface with no required properties - (NOT COMMON, except for things like `React.Component<{}, State>`) */
  obj3: {};
  /** a dict object with any number of properties of the same type */
  dict1: {
    [key: string]: MyTypeHere;
  };
  dict2: Record<string, MyTypeHere>; // equivalent to dict1
  /** function that doesn't take or return anything (VERY COMMON) */
  onClick: () => void;
  /** function with named prop (VERY COMMON) */
  onChange: (id: number) => void;
  /** function type syntax that takes an event (VERY COMMON) */
  onChange: (event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) => void;
  /** alternative function type syntax that takes an event (VERY COMMON) */
  onClick(event: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>): void;
  /** any function as long as you don't invoke it (not recommended) */
  onSomething: Function;
  /** an optional prop (VERY COMMON!) */
  optional?: OptionalType;
  /** when passing down the state setter function returned by `useState` to a child component. `number` is an example, swap out with whatever the type of your state */
  setState: React.Dispatch<React.SetStateAction<number>>;
};
```

## Hooks and TypeScript

The type definitions from `@types/react` include types for the built-in Hooks, so you can use them in your components without any additional setup. They are built to take into account the code you write in your component, so you will get **inferred types** a lot of the time.

### useState

Usually, you can just use infer types:
```js
// Infer the type as "boolean"
const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState(false);
```
But you still can do it explicitly, but not necessary:
```ts
const [enabled, setEnabled] = useState<boolean>(false);
```

For object type, usually implement like this: 
```ts
// ...
const [user, serUser] = useState<User | null> (null);
// ...
const name = user?.name;
```

### useRef

```ts
const ref = useRef<HTMLElement | null> (null);
return <button ref={ref}>Click Me</button>
```

### useReducer

Exampel:
```ts
import {useReducer} from 'react';

interface State {
   count: number 
};
type CounterAction =
  | { type: "reset" }
  | { type: "setCount"; value: State["count"] };
const initialState: State = { count: 0 };
function stateReducer(state: State, action: CounterAction): State {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "reset":
      return initialState;
    case "setCount":
      return { ...state, count: action.value };
    default:
      throw new Error("Unknown action");
  }
}

export default function App() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(stateReducer, initialState);
  const addFive = () => dispatch({ type: "setCount", value: state.count + 5 });
  const reset = () => dispatch({ type: "reset" });
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to my counter</h1>
      <p>Count: {state.count}</p>
      <button onClick={addFive}>Add 5</button>
      <button onClick={reset}>Reset</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
We are using TypeScript in a few key places:

- `interface State` describes the shape of the reducer’s state.
- `type CounterAction` describes the different actions which can be dispatched to the reducer.
- `const initialState: State` provides a type for the initial state, and also the type which is used by useReducer by default.
- `stateReducer(state: State, action: CounterAction): State` sets the types for the reducer function’s arguments and return value.

### useContext
The useContext Hook is a technique for passing data down the component tree without having to pass props through components. It is used by creating a provider component and often by creating a Hook to consume the value in a child component.

```ts
import { createContext, useContext, useState } from 'react';

type Theme = "light" | "dark" | "system";
const ThemeContext = createContext<Theme|null>(null);
const useGetTheme = () => useContext(ThemeContext);

export default function MyApp() {
  const [theme, setTheme] = useState<Theme>('light');
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
      <MyComponent />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  )
}

function MyComponent() {
  const theme = useGetTheme();
  if (!theme) { throw new Error("theme must be used within a Provider") }
  return (
    <div>
      <p>Current theme: {theme}</p>
    </div>
  )
}
```

### useMemo
### useCallback

## DOM Events Types

When working with DOM events in React, the type of the event can often be inferred from the event handler. However, when you want to extract a function to be passed to an event handler, you will need to **explicitly** set the type of the event.

### Basic example

```ts
export default function Form() {
  const [value, setValue] = useState("Change me");

  function handleChange(event: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>) {
    setValue(event.currentTarget.value);
  }
  return (
    <>
      <input value={value} onChange={handleChange} />
      <p>Value: {value}</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

### form elements and onChange event types

All the form elements events are the type `React.ChangeEvent<T>` , where `T` is the HTML Element type. Here’s an example of all the different HTML types: 

- For `<input type="text">` the event type is `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>`
- For `<textarea>` is `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLTextAreaElement>`
- For `<select>` we use `React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputSelect>`

### How to know the type of the event

It's not always clear what type you should give to the e inside your `onChange` function.
This can happen with `onClick`, `onSubmit`, or any of the other event handlers that DOM elements receive.

Here are some solution:
- In VS Code, hover over the type of the thing you're trying to pass in, you can see, this outputs to show the type.
- Create an inline function inside `onChange`: `<input onChange={(e) => {}} />`; Now you have access to `e`, you can hover over it and get the correct event type.
- Using `React.ComponentProps` like this:
```ts
const onChange: React.ComponentProps<"input">["onChange"] =
  (e) => {
    console.log(e);
  };
<input onChange={onChange} />;
```
- Using type helper called `EventFor`

## Useful Types 

### Children 

There are two common paths to describing the children of a component. The first is to use the `React.ReactNode` type, which is a union of all the possible types that can be passed as children in JSX:
```ts
interface ModalRendererProps {
  title: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}
```
This is a very broad definition of children. The second is to use the `React.ReactElement` type, which is only JSX elements and not JavaScript primitives like strings or numbers:
```ts
interface ModalRendererProps {
  title: string;
  children: React.ReactElement;
}
```

> Note, that you cannot use TypeScript to describe that the children are a certain type of JSX elements, so you cannot use the type-system to describe a component which only accepts `<li>` children.

### Style Props

When using inline styles in React, you can use `React.CSSProperties` to describe the object passed to the style prop. This type is a union of all the possible CSS properties, and is a good way to ensure you are passing valid CSS properties to the style prop, and to get auto-complete in your editor.

```ts
interface MyComponentProps {
  style: React.CSSProperties;
}
```

### React.ComponentProps

When you component wrap basic elements, like div, button, you can use `React.ComponentProps` accept all the props for that elements. 

```ts
import { ComponentProps } from "react";

type MyDivProps = ComponentProps<"div"> & {
  myProp: string;
};

const MyDiv = ({ myProp, ...props }: MyDivProps) => {
  console.log(myProp!);
  return <div {...props} />;
};
```

There are also `ComponentPropsWithRef`,  `ComponentPropsWithoutRef` available.

## Implement Types
The more type information provided to TypeScript, the more powerful its type checking is. 

### Naming Conventions

- Use `PascalCase` for type names.
- Do not use the `I` prefix for interfaces. (Something that was copied from statically typed languages)
- Use `_` prefix for private properties.
- Use consistent naming for component props types (For example, type CustomComponentProps)

### Where To Put Your Types in Application Code

- Rule 1: When a type is used in only one place, put it in the same file where it's used.
```ts
interface Props {
  foo: string
  bar: number
}
export const MyComponent = (props: Props) => {
  // ...
}
```
And when types are truly single-use, You can even inline them:
```ts
export const MyComponent = (props: {foo: string; bar: number}) => {
  // ...
}
```

- Rule 2: Types that are used in more than one place should be moved to a shared location.
```
|- src
  |- components
    |- MyComponent.tsx
  |- shared.types.ts
```
If they're only used in the components folder, I'll put them there:
```
|- src
  |- components-
    |- MyComponent.tsx
    |- components.types.ts
```
In other words, I share the type across the **smallest** number of modules that need it.

- Rule 3: Types that are used in more than one package in a monorepo should be moved to a shared package.
if you're working on a monorepo with multiple packages?
In that case, you should move shared types to a shared package.
```
|- apps
  |- app
  |- website
  |- docs
|- packages
  |- types
    |- src
      |- shared.types.ts
```

### export import types

types.ts file:
```ts
export type Launch = {
  id: string;
  full_name: string;
};
```
you can use `import` or `import type`:
```ts
import type {Launch} from './types';
```

### Namespaces
As your project size increases, so will the number of types. There is a good chance that there will be name collisions. Namespaces are the solution to this problem. A namespace will not only avoid multiple type declarations but also provide an organisational structure to your projects. Using namespaces effectively can make your codebase clean. 

### Keyof, Typeof

In Typescript, it can use the `typeof` operator to get the exact type definition of a variable. `typeof` can be used to infer types.
 
The `keyof` operator is introduced by typescript. It gives the properties of an object type in form of a union. For example:
```ts
type X = {a: number; b: boolean;};
const x: X = {a: 1, b: false};
// Y = 'a' | 'b'
type Y = keyof X;
const y: Y = 'a';
/* Without explicitly specifying y as type Y TS will infer its type as string and will throw an error about indexing type X using string */
console.log(x[y]);
```

You will often be using typeof and keyof operators in combination, typeof to get the type of an object and keyof to index it.

### @types

`@types` is a special directory in typescript. It is [DefintelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) which is maintained by TypeScript. DefinitelyTyped try to conclude all the types used in TypeScript, including build-in libraryies and third libraryies.

You can find `@types` dictionary in React project `node_modules`. The declaration file (*.d.ts files, e.g. index.d.ts) are auto recognised by your project’s `tsconfig` as the root types files. The types defined in these files can be used as global types in your project.

For example `@types/react/index.d.ts`, which difine type for React project.

### Utility Types

Typescript provides several utility types which help you transform your type definitions. Some of my commonly used utility types are:

- Partial<Type> constructs type with all the properties of the type set to optional.
```ts
type X = {a: number;}
// Y = Partial<X> = {a?: number;} or {a: number | undefined;}
type Y = Partial<X>
```

- Required<Type> constructs type with all the properties of the type set to required.
```ts
type X = {a?: number;}
// Y = Required<X> = {a: number;}
type Y = Required<X>
```

- Record<Keys, Type> constructs an object type with property key of type Keys and property value of type Type.
```ts
// X = {[key: string]: number;}
type X = Record<string, number>
```

- Omit<Type, Keys> constructs a type from type Type after removing key Keys (string literal or union of strings).
```ts
type X = {a: number; b: boolean; c: string;}
// Y = {b: boolean; c: string;}
type Y = Omit<X, 'a'>
// Z = {c: string;}
type Z = Omit<X, 'a' | 'b'>
```
There are many more Utility Types in typescript and these will help you avoid rewriting your type definitions for every individual or derivable type.

You can also write custom utility types, like the Optional type provided in the `@types/index.d.ts` file. Optional type is used to make only selected properties optional in a type.

### Generics

> Definiton: 
> Generics take type(s) as input and use them to derive the type of variables or functions.

> Purpose: 
> Generics type give you chance to describe the type **relationship** between input and output.

```ts
function identity<T>(arg: T): T {
  return arg;
}
/* Explicitly*/
identity<string>("Hello");
/* Implicitly */
identity("World")
```

```ts
type ButtonProp<T> = {
  count: T;
  countHistory: T[];
}
function Button<T> ({count, countHistory}: ButtonProp<T>) {
  return <button>Click Me</button>;
}
```

Use generics to make your code reusable without writing multiple type definitions.


### The `unknown` Type

- The `any` type is container type, but `unknown` type is not.
- All assignments to the `unknown` variable are considered type-correct. But the `unknown` type is only assignable to the `any` type and the `unknown` type itself.
- You can narrow `unknown` type and use them.

#### Narrowing the `unknown` Type

You need to **narrow** the `unknown` Type first before using it. 
For example using:
- `typeof` operators 
- `instanceof` operators 
- custom type guard function
- third lib schema, like Zod.

Custom type guard function Example :
```ts
function isNumberArray(value: unknown): value is number[] {
  return (
    Array.isArray(value) && value.every(element => typeof element === "number")
  );
}
const unknownValue: unknown = [15, 23, 8, 4, 42, 16];
if (isNumberArray(unknownValue)) {
  // Within this branch, `unknownValue` has type `number[]`,
  // so we can spread the numbers as arguments to `Math.max`
  const max = Math.max(...unknownValue);
  console.log(max);
}
```

Zod example
```ts
import { z } from "zod";
// creating a schema for strings
const mySchema = z.string();
// parsing
mySchema.parse("tuna"); // => "tuna"
mySchema.parse(12); // => throws ZodError
// "safe" parsing (doesn't throw error if validation fails)
mySchema.safeParse("tuna"); // => { success: true; data: "tuna" }
mySchema.safeParse(12); // => { success: false; error: ZodError }
```

#### Using Type Assertions with `unknown`
If you want to force the compiler to trust you that a value of type `unknown` is of a given type, you can use a type assertion like this:
```ts
const value: unknown = "Hello World";
const someString: string = value as string;
const otherString = someString.toUpperCase(); // "HELLO WORLD"
```

#### `unknown` in Union and Intersection Types

In union, any of the constituent types is `unknown`, the union type evaluates to `unknown`, except `any`.
In intersection, intersecting any type with unknown doesn't change the resulting type. 
```ts
type UnionType1 = unknown | null; // unknown
type UnionType2 = unknown | undefined; // unknown
type UnionType3 = unknown | string; // unknown
type UnionType4 = unknown | number[]; // unknown

type UnionType5 = unknown | any; // any

type IntersectionType1 = unknown & null; // null
type IntersectionType2 = unknown & undefined; // undefined
type IntersectionType3 = unknown & string; // string
type IntersectionType4 = unknown & number[]; // number[]
type IntersectionType5 = unknown & any; // any
```

#### use `unknown` type in fetch

The `data` is `any` type when fetching!

- Using Zod: 
```ts
useEffect(()=>{
  fetch("http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
    .then((response)=>response.json())
    .then((data: unknown)=>{
      // use Zod
      // for example: const todo = todoSchema.parse(data); 
      // ...
    });
},[]);
```
- Using ts-reset: `.json` (in fetch) and `JSON.parse` both return `unknown`.

### Type Assertions

Type assertion allows you to set the type of a value and tell the compiler not to infer it.

You may do this to make thing simple: 
```ts
type ButtonColor = 'red'| 'blue' | 'green';

useEffect (()=>{
  const previousButtonColor = localStorage.getItem('buttonColor') as ButtonColor;
},[]);
```

### `Omit<>`

```ts
type User = {
  name: string;
  sessionId: number;
}
type Guest = Omit<User, `name`>; // then, Guest type just contain sessionId. 
```

### JSX.Element vs ReactNode vs ReactElement

A **`ReactElement`** is an object with type, props, and key properties:
```ts
interface ReactElement<
  P = any,
  T extends
    | string
    | JSXElementConstructor<any> = string
    | JSXElementConstructor<any>,
> {
  type: T;
  props: P;
  key: string | null;
}
```

A **`JSX.Element`** is a `ReactElement<any, any>`. It exists as various libraries can implement JSX in their own way:
```ts
declare global {
  // …
  namespace JSX {
    // …
    interface Element extends React.ReactElement<any, any> {}
    // …
  }
  // …
}
```

A **ReactPortal** is a `ReactElement` with a children property:
```ts
interface ReactPortal extends ReactElement {
  children: ReactNode;
}
```

A **ReactNode** is a `ReactElement`, `string`, `number`, `Iterable<ReactNode>`, `ReactPortal`, `boolean`, `null`, or `undefined`:
```ts
type ReactNode =
  | ReactElement
  | string
  | number
  | Iterable<ReactNode>
  | ReactPortal
  | boolean
  | null
  | undefined;
```
Example:
```ts
<div> // <- ReactElement
  <Component> // <- ReactElement
    {condition && 'text'} // <- ReactNode
  </Component>
</div>
```

Due to historical reasons, `render` methods of class components return `ReactNode`, but function components return `ReactElement`.
