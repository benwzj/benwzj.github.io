Both of them are Server side application frameworks for NodeJS.

## ExpressJS
ExpressJS is Lightweight and the most widely-used.
The strengths of Express is its strong community and the number of available plugins.

## NestJS
Nest is a progressive framework. It is built with TypeScript and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).
Under the hood, Nest makes use of ExpressJS.
The architecture of NestJS is heavily inspired by Angular.

## ExpressJS vs. NestJS
The biggest difference between these frameworks is that NestJS is opinionated, and ExpressJS is not. It means Express gives developers the freedom to make multiple possibilities and implement code as per the need, as it doesn’t have a set of pre-defined rules to follow. Such a flexibility is appreciated by many developers, and it’s beneficial for smaller flexible teams, but once team size and app’s complexity grows, the lack of structure becomes a problem.
