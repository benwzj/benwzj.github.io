## What is Ref

> ##### The Definition
> 
> When you want a component to “remember” some information, but you don’t want that information to trigger new renders, you can use a `ref`.
{: .block-warning }

You can access the current value of that ref through the `ref.current` property. This value is intentionally mutable, meaning you can both read and write to it. It’s like a secret pocket of your component that React doesn’t track. (This is what makes it an “escape hatch” from React’s one-way data flow—more on that below!)

### Ref vs State

- Like `state`: `ref` could point to anything: a string, an object, or even a function. 
- Unlike `state`: `state` is ”Immutable” — you must use the state setting function to modify state variables to queue a re-render; `ref` is mutable, it is a **plain** JavaScript object with the current property that you can read and modify.
- Like `state`, `refs` are retained by React between re-renders. **However**, setting `state` re-renders a component. Setting `ref` won't.
- Unlike `state`, You shouldn’t read (or write) the `ref.current` value during rendering. You can read state any time.


### Adding a ref to your component

```js
import { useRef } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  let ref = useRef(0);

  function handleClick() {
    ref.current = ref.current + 1;
    alert('You clicked ' + ref.current + ' times!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me!
    </button>
  );
}
```
