## What is Refs

> ##### The Definition
> 
> When you want a component to “remember” some information, but you don’t want that information to trigger new renders, you can use a `ref`.
{: .block-warning }

You can access the current value of that ref through the `ref.current` property. This value is intentionally mutable, meaning you can both read and write to it. 
It’s like a secret pocket of your component that React doesn’t track. (This is what makes it an “escape hatch” from React’s one-way data flow—more on that below!)

Refs are a generic concept, but most often you’ll use them to hold DOM elements.

### Ref vs State

- `state` and `ref` could point to anything: a string, an object, or even a function. 
- `state` and `refs` both are live outside of your component.
- `state` and `refs` both are retained by React between re-renders. 
- Mutating `state` cause re-render. Mutating `ref` won't.
- `state` works as snapshot for each render, You can't get latest state from an asynchronous operation; But `ref` won't be affected by render, you can read the latest ref anytime.
- `state` is ”Immutable” — you must use the state setting function to modify state variables to queue a re-render; `ref` is mutable, it is a **plain** JavaScript object that you can read and modify.
- You shouldn’t read (or write) the `ref.current` value during rendering. But You can read `state` any time. 

## Using `ref`

### Example: alerting how many click have happen.
```js
import { useRef } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  let ref = useRef(0);

  function handleClick() {
    ref.current = ref.current + 1;
    alert('You clicked ' + ref.current + ' times!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me!
    </button>
  );
}
```

### DebouncedButton component

If you keep clicking the button, it will ignore the click event, untill you stop and wait a second. This is called **Debounced**. `ref` is good way to implement this:
```js
import {useRef} from 'react';

function DebouncedButton({ onClick, children }) {
  const timeoutID = useRef(null);
  return (
    <button onClick={() => {
      clearTimeout(timeoutID.current);
      timeoutID.current = setTimeout(() => {
        onClick();
      }, 1000);
    }}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## When to use refs 

Typically, you will use a ref when your component needs to “step outside” React and communicate with external APIs—often a browser API that won’t impact the appearance of the component. Here are a few of these rare situations:

- Storing and manipulating **DOM elements** (the most common use case).
- Storing **timeout IDs**
- Storing other objects that aren’t necessary to calculate the JSX.

If your component needs to store some value, but it doesn’t impact the rendering logic, choose refs.

## Best practices for refs 
Following these principles will make your components more predictable:

- **Treat refs as an escape hatch**. Refs are useful when you work with external systems or browser APIs. If much of your application logic and data flow relies on refs, you might want to rethink your approach.
- **Don’t read or write `ref.current` during rendering**. If some information is needed during rendering, use state instead. Since React doesn’t know when `ref.current` changes, even reading it while rendering makes your component’s behavior difficult to predict. (The only exception to this is code like `if (!ref.current) ref.current = new Thing()` which only sets the ref once during the first render.)

## Manipulating the DOM with Refs

React automatically updates the DOM to match your render output, so your components won’t often need to manipulate it. **However**, sometimes you might need access to the DOM elements managed by React, for example, to focus a node, scroll to it, or measure its size and position. There is no built-in way to do those things in React, so you will need a `ref` to the DOM node.

You can instruct React to put a DOM node into `myRef.current` by passing `<div ref={myRef}>`. Once the element is removed from the DOM, React will update `myRef.current` to be `null`. 

### Getting a ref to the node

To access a DOM node managed by React: 
- first, import the useRef Hook:
`import { useRef } from 'react';`
- Then, use it to declare a ref inside your component:
`const myRef = useRef(null);`
- Finally, pass your `ref` as the `ref` attribute to the JSX tag for which you want to get the DOM node:
`<div ref={myRef}>`

The `useRef` Hook returns an object with a single property called current. Initially, `myRef.current` will be `null`.

When React creates a DOM node for this` <div>`, React will put a reference to this node into `myRef.current`. You can then access this DOM node from your event handlers and use the built-in browser APIs defined on it.
Then:
```js
// You can use any browser APIs, for example:
myRef.current.scrollIntoView();
```

### `ref` callback

Sometimes you might need a `ref` to each item in the list, and you don’t know how many you will have.

`ref` callback can let you manage a list of refs! 

The idea is like this:
`ref` doesn’t hold a single DOM node. Instead, it holds a **Map** from item ID to a DOM node. The `ref` callback on every list item takes care to update the Map.
You can pass a function to the `ref` attribute. And then React will call your `ref` callback with the DOM node when it’s time to set the `ref`, and with `null` when it’s time to clear it. This lets you maintain your own array or a Map, and access any `ref` by its index or some kind of ID.

It works liks this:
```js
// 1. define ref
const itemsRef = useRef(null);
// 2. ref callback function
function getMap() {
  if (!itemsRef.current) {
    // Initialize the Map on first usage.
    itemsRef.current = new Map();
  }
  return itemsRef.current;
}
// 3. tell React how to arrange the ref to nodes list.
const catList = [];
for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  catList.push({
    id: i,
    imageUrl: 'https://placekitten.com/250/200?image=' + i
  });
}
return (
    <>
      <div>
        <ul>
          {catList.map(cat => (
            <li
              key={cat.id}
              ref={(node) => {
                const map = getMap();
                if (node) {
                  map.set(cat.id, node);
                } else {
                  map.delete(cat.id);
                }
              }}
            >
              <img
                src={cat.imageUrl}
                alt={'Cat #' + cat.id}
              />
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      </div>
    </>
  );

// 4. now you can access individual DOM nodes from the Map according to ID:.
function getNodeByID(itemId) {
  const map = getMap();
  const node = map.get(itemId);
  return node;
}

```

### Accessing component’s DOM nodes 

When you put a `ref` on a **built-in** component that outputs a browser element like `<input />`, React will set that `ref`’s `current` property to the corresponding DOM node (such as the actual `<input />` in the browser).

However, if you try to put a `ref` on your own component, like `<MyInput />`, by default you will get `null`. This is **intentional**. 

Accessing component’s DOM nodes, you should use `React.forwardRef()`

#### React.forwardRef()
```js
import { forwardRef, useRef } from 'react';

const MyInput = forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <input {...props} ref={ref} />;
});

export default function Form() {
  const inputRef = useRef(null);

  function handleClick() {
    inputRef.current.focus();
  }

  return (
    <>
      <MyInput ref={inputRef} />
      <button onClick={handleClick}>
        Focus the input
      </button>
    </>
  );
}

```
This is how it works:

- `<MyInput ref={inputRef} />` tells React to put the corresponding DOM node into inputRef.current. However, it’s up to the MyInput component to opt into that—by default, it doesn’t.
- The MyInput component is declared using `forwardRef`. This opts it into receiving the inputRef from above as the second `ref` argument which is declared after props.
- MyInput itself passes the `ref` it received to the `<input>` inside of it.

> `useImperativeHandle()`
> This function can restrict the exposed functionality of the `ref` 

### When React attaches the refs 

In React, every update is split in two phases:
1. During render, React calls your components to figure out what should be on the screen.
2. During commit, React applies changes to the DOM.

React sets `ref.current` during the commit. Before updating the DOM, React sets the affected ref.current values to null. After updating the DOM, React immediately sets them to the corresponding DOM nodes.

In general, you don’t want to access `refs` during rendering. That goes for `refs` holding DOM nodes as well. During the first render, the DOM nodes have not yet been created, so ref.current will be null. And during the rendering of updates, the DOM nodes haven’t been updated yet. So it’s too early to read them.

### Best practices for DOM manipulation with refs 
- Refs are an escape hatch. You should only use them when you have to “step outside React”. Common examples of this include managing focus, scroll position, or calling browser APIs that React does not expose.

- If you stick to **non-destructive** actions like focusing and scrolling, you shouldn’t encounter any problems. However, if you try to modify the DOM manually, you can risk conflicting with the changes React is making.
