## What is Refs

> ##### The Definition
> 
> When you want a component to “remember” some information, but you don’t want that information to trigger new renders, you can use a `ref`.
{: .block-warning }

You can access the current value of that ref through the `ref.current` property. This value is intentionally mutable, meaning you can both read and write to it. It’s like a secret pocket of your component that React doesn’t track. (This is what makes it an “escape hatch” from React’s one-way data flow—more on that below!)

### Ref vs State

- Like `state`: `ref` could point to anything: a string, an object, or even a function. 
- Unlike `state`: `state` is ”Immutable” — you must use the state setting function to modify state variables to queue a re-render; `ref` is mutable, it is a **plain** JavaScript object with the current property that you can read and modify.
- Like `state`, `refs` are retained by React between re-renders. **However**, setting `state` re-renders a component. Setting `ref` won't.
- Unlike `state`, You shouldn’t read (or write) the `ref.current` value during rendering. You can read state any time.


### Adding a ref to your component

```js
import { useRef } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  let ref = useRef(0);

  function handleClick() {
    ref.current = ref.current + 1;
    alert('You clicked ' + ref.current + ' times!');
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>
      Click me!
    </button>
  );
}
```

## When to use refs 

Typically, you will use a ref when your component needs to “step outside” React and communicate with external APIs—often a browser API that won’t impact the appearance of the component. Here are a few of these rare situations:

- Storing **timeout IDs**
- Storing and manipulating **DOM elements**.
- Storing other objects that aren’t necessary to calculate the JSX.

If your component needs to store some value, but it doesn’t impact the rendering logic, choose refs.

### Best practices for refs 
Following these principles will make your components more predictable:

- **Treat refs as an escape hatch**. Refs are useful when you work with external systems or browser APIs. If much of your application logic and data flow relies on refs, you might want to rethink your approach.
- **Don’t read or write `ref.current` during rendering**. If some information is needed during rendering, use state instead. Since React doesn’t know when `ref.current` changes, even reading it while rendering makes your component’s behavior difficult to predict. (The only exception to this is code like `if (!ref.current) ref.current = new Thing()` which only sets the ref once during the first render.)
