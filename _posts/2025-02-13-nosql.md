## What is NoSQL

When talking about NoSQL database, there are many concepts are based on or compare to SQL database concepts. SQL database have much longer history and it is very mature.

Here are some points for NoSQL database: 
- NoSQL databases store data differently than relational tables.
- It come out mostly because storage is getting cheaper.
- It store data in a more natural and flexible way than relational tables.
- The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph.
- You can say it is Schemaless Database.
- They are BASE compliance. And some can be ACID compliance as well.


## Brief history of NoSQL databases

NoSQL databases emerged in the late 2000s as **the cost of storage dramatically decreased**. Gone were the days of needing to create a complex, difficult-to-manage data model in order to avoid data duplication. NoSQL databases optimized for developer productivity.

In the early 2000s, a paper published by Google on BigTable, the wide-column database, explored the wide range of possibilities for a distributed storage system. 2009 saw a major rise in NoSQL databases, with two key document-oriented databases, MongoDB and CouchDB, coming into the picture.

## Features

At a high level, NoSQL databases typically have the following features:
- Distributed computing
- Easy to scale out
- Flexible schemas and rich query language
- Ease of use for developers
- Partition tolerance
- High availability

## BASE compliance

NoSQL databases are BASE compliant, i.e., (Basic Availability Soft state Eventual consistency). 
- Basic availability refers to the ability of the system to tolerate a partial failure (like a loss of a node). 
- Soft state means that the system allows temporary inconsistencies before eventually achieving consistency automatically over time. 

BASE compliance ensures high availability, faster data processing, scalability, and flexibility. However, MongoDB can also be configured to provide multi-document **ACID compliance**(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability).

## Common Misconception

### NoSQL databases don't store relationship data well 
NoSQL databases can store relationship data — they just store it differently than relational databases do.
In fact, many find modeling relationship data in NoSQL databases to be easier than in relational databases because related data doesn't have to be split between tables. NoSQL data models allow related data to be nested within a single data structure.

### NoSQL databases don't support ACID transactions
Some NoSQL databases, like MongoDB, do, in fact, support ACID transactions.

## Schemaless Database

Schemaless database is compare to traditional SQL database.
A schemaless database, like MongoDB, does not have these up-front constraints, mapping to a more ‘natural’ database. Any data, formatted or not, can be stored in a non-tabular NoSQL type of database.

### How does a schemaless database work?
In schemaless databases, information is stored in JSON-style documents which can have varying sets of fields with different data types for each field. So, a collection could look like this:
```json
    { 
        name : “Joe”, age : 30, interests : ‘football’ }
    { 
        name : “Kate”, age : 25 }
```  
As you can see, the data itself normally has a fairly consistent structure. With the schemaless MongoDB database, there is some additional structure — the system namespace contains an explicit list of collections and indexes. Collections may be implicitly or explicitly created — indexes must be explicitly declared.

## MongoDB

### Terms
- MongoDB Compass: It is a software which is database window interface, something like 'MySQLWorkbench'.
- MongoDB Shell (mongosh): Can run commands
- Collection: similar to table in SQL DB
- Documents: similar to row in SQL DB
- Field: similar to column in SQL DB

### Query
Use `find` command: `db.movies.find( { "title": "Titanic" } )`.
- You can 'Project Fields' for your return by using 'Project Selectors'.
- You can filter document for your return by using 'Query Selectors'.
- You can sort, limit return.

#### Matches any of the values specified in an array or NOT in array
`$in` and `$nin`

For example:
`db.movies.find( { rated: { $in: [ "PG", "PG-13" ] } } )`
This operation corresponds to the following SQL statement:
`SELECT * FROM movies WHERE rated in ("PG", "PG-13")`

#### Matches values that are equal or greater or less to a specified value.
- `$eq`
- `$gt`
- `$gte`
- `$lt`
- `$lte`
- `$ne`

For example:
`db.movies.find( { countries: "Mexico","imdb.rating": { $gte: 7 } } )`

#### Logical Operators
- `$and`
- `$or`

For example:
`db.movies.find( { $and: [ {countries: "Mexico"} , {"imdb.rating": { $gte: 7 }} ] } )`

### Aggregation

Aggregation operations process multiple documents and return computed results. You can use aggregation operations to:
- Group values from multiple documents together.
- Perform operations on the grouped data to return a single result.
- Analyze data changes over time.

#### Aggregate Pipelines Example:
```
db.orders.aggregate( [
   // Stage 1: Filter pizza order documents by pizza size
   {
      $match: { size: "medium" }
   },
   // Stage 2: Group remaining documents by pizza name and calculate total quantity
   {
      $group: { _id: "$name", totalQuantity: { $sum: "$quantity" } }
   }
] )
```

##### The `$match` stage:
Filters the pizza order documents to pizzas with a size of medium.
Passes the remaining documents to the $group stage.

##### The `$group` stage:
Groups the remaining documents by pizza name.
Uses `$sum` to calculate the total order quantity for each pizza name. The total is stored in the totalQuantity field returned by the aggregation pipeline.

#### What is Aggregate Pipelines
An aggregation pipeline consists of one or more stages that process documents:
- Each stage performs an operation on the input documents. For example, a stage can filter documents, group documents, and calculate values.
- The documents that are output from a stage are passed to the next stage.
- An aggregation pipeline can return results for groups of documents. For example, return the total, average, maximum, and minimum values.

#### Aggregate Pipelines Stages

Each States have a name, like `$match`, `$group`, `$sort` etc.

### distinct()
`db.collection.distinct()`
Finds the distinct values for a specified field across a single collection or view and returns the results in an array.

This can help you to understand the data in the collection.
