When talking about NoSQL database, there are many concepts are based on or compare to SQL database concepts. SQL database have more longer history and it is very mature.

Here are some points: 
- NoSQL databases store data differently than relational tables.
- It store data in a more natural and flexible way than relational tables.
- The main types are document, key-value, wide-column, and graph.

## Brief history of NoSQL databases

NoSQL databases emerged in the late 2000s as **the cost of storage dramatically decreased**. Gone were the days of needing to create a complex, difficult-to-manage data model in order to avoid data duplication. NoSQL databases optimized for developer productivity.

In the early 2000s, a paper published by Google on BigTable, the wide-column database, explored the wide range of possibilities for a distributed storage system. 2009 saw a major rise in NoSQL databases, with two key document-oriented databases, MongoDB and CouchDB, coming into the picture.

## Features

At a high level, NoSQL databases typically have the following features:
- Distributed computing
- Easy to scale out
- Flexible schemas and rich query language
- Ease of use for developers
- Partition tolerance
- High availability

## BASE compliance

NoSQL databases are BASE compliant, i.e., (Basic Availability Soft state Eventual consistency). 
- Basic availability refers to the ability of the system to tolerate a partial failure (like a loss of a node). 
- Soft state means that the system allows temporary inconsistencies before eventually achieving consistency automatically over time. 

BASE compliance ensures high availability, faster data processing, scalability, and flexibility. However, MongoDB can also be configured to provide multi-document **ACID compliance**(Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, and Durability).

## Common Misconception

### NoSQL databases don't store relationship data well 
NoSQL databases can store relationship data — they just store it differently than relational databases do.
In fact, many find modeling relationship data in NoSQL databases to be easier than in relational databases because related data doesn't have to be split between tables. NoSQL data models allow related data to be nested within a single data structure.

### NoSQL databases don't support ACID transactions
Some NoSQL databases, like MongoDB, do, in fact, support ACID transactions.

## Schemaless Database

Schemaless database is compare to traditional SQL database.
A schemaless database, like MongoDB, does not have these up-front constraints, mapping to a more ‘natural’ database. Any data, formatted or not, can be stored in a non-tabular NoSQL type of database.

### How does a schemaless database work?
In schemaless databases, information is stored in JSON-style documents which can have varying sets of fields with different data types for each field. So, a collection could look like this:
```json
    { 
        name : “Joe”, age : 30, interests : ‘football’ }
    { 
        name : “Kate”, age : 25 }
```  
As you can see, the data itself normally has a fairly consistent structure. With the schemaless MongoDB database, there is some additional structure — the system namespace contains an explicit list of collections and indexes. Collections may be implicitly or explicitly created — indexes must be explicitly declared.
