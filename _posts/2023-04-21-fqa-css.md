### why height : 50% is not working? 
need to do following first: 
body {
height: 100vh; 
}

### what is vh? 
Viewport-percentage Height, also , we have vw, vmin, vmax
vh unit, equal to 1% of the height of initial containing block. 
or use height: 50vh, it is working! 
They are working well elegantly!

### What is min-height?
this property set the minimum height.

### Show button on hover only
When hover a todo item, then show the delete button: 
```css
.hover_button {
  display: none;
}
label:hover + .hover_button, .hover_button:hover {
  display: inline-block;
}
```
HTML:
```html
<li >
  <label>
    this is the todo item
  </label>
  <button className=" hover_button">Del</button>
</li>
```
By doing this, we're using the adjacent sibling css selector `+`. The selector is pretty simple: on label "hovering", you select .hover_button (its sibling) and display it. Here, I added .hover_button:hover so that when the user "hovers" the button, it keeps it visible (prevent a blinking effect as the user moves the mouse over the button).
