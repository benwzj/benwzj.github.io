- Python is an object oriented programming language.
- Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.
- A Class is like an object constructor, or a "blueprint" for creating objects.
- Different from JavaScript, there are no primitives in Python. 
- Python have a good documentation.

## Python vs. JavaScript

### REPL
REPL(Read-Eval-Print-Loop)
- Python has it's own interpreter. And Python have different version interpreter. For example Pythone 2.7 still popular, but the new stable version is 3.10 at the moment. something like: python3 yourcode.py
- JavaScript need a JavaScript runtime to support, like Browser, NodeJS. 

### Code Blocks
- JavaScript makes use of curly brackets for defining code blocks. Python, on the other hand, uses indentation for defining code blocks. 
- While JavaScript has the semi-colon (;) that serves as the statement terminator (though it is not mandatory), Python uses a newline.

### Data type

#### Mutability
- Python support mutable data type, like set, and immutable data type, like list. 
- JavaScript have primitive type concept which are immutable. All object is mutable. But each property of the object have it's own descriptor which can config the mutability of the property.

#### Number
- In python, there are different numeric type like int, float, fixed-point decimal.
- In JavaScript, there are number and bigInt. Number type is double floating point number.

#### Object

- Objects are Python’s abstraction for data. All data in a Python program is represented by objects or by relations between objects. (Everything in python is object)
- Is it everything is object in JavaScript? NO, primitive is not object. 
- Object in JavaScript, is very easy to create. But in Python, Each object has a class from which it is instantiated.
- In JavaScript, a simple iterator can be: 

```js
let myIter = {
  n: 0,
  next: function() {
    return (value: this.n++, done: false};
  }
}
```

- In Python, a iterator looks like:

```py
class MyNumbers:
  def __iter__(self):
    self.n = 0
    return self

  def __next__(self):
    self.n += 1
    return self.n

myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)
next(myiter)
```

### Class

#### JavaScript class
- JavaScript class, which have been described as syntax sugar, is build on the top of prototype chain.
- JavaScript class works very well. You don’t need to always translate back to prototype chain to understand the code. 
- JavaScript actually implement class as function. 
- JavaScript class support class, new, constructor, extends, super, static key words. JavaScript class put everything in one place, to implement OOP coding concept which similar to Java, C++. 

#### Python class
- Each value is an object. Each object is an instance of a class. Even a class is an instance of the metaclass - type. 
- class itself is an object. class instance is an object too. 
- class in python is not function. 
- Method object is not Function object in Python! But they are same thing in JavaScript.
- Python supports a form of multiple inheritance. But JavaScript support just one.

### iterable, iterator

#### JavaScript
- An object is iterable if it implement the @@iterator method.
- An object is iterator when it implements the `next()` according to some semantics:
`done_value_object = myIterator.next(). `
// if done == false, can keep calling `myIterator.next()` to return done_value_object.
// if done == true, then iterator is completed.  

#### Python
 Python have different concepts of iterator and iterable from JavaScript. 

- exception StopIteration is used to signal the end of an iteration.
- built-in function `iter()` and `next()` used to implement iteration.

### generator

#### JavaScript generator
- syntax: `* function (){}`
- generator is an iterator which maintain by the language itself.
- a generator object (iterator) for the function will be returned when meet yield.
- yield will return value. 
- generator function also support return keyword. generator function will totally complete when return. 
- generator can work with promise to make code better.

#### Python generator
- syntax: when a function contain keyword yield, then it is generator.
- If you used `next()` after iteration have been completed, then you’ll get an explicit StopIteration exception.

### Static method

static concept is similar between Python, JavaScript, C++, Java. 
static methods can be accessed from classes instead of instants. 

#### in JavaScript 
- there are static keyword. 
- static method can’t be access by instance. 

#### in Python 
- Using built-in function staticmethod() to turn method to static. But can using syntaxtic sugar decorator @staticmethod

- static methods can be access both by class and instance. 
`Class.staticmethodFunc()`
or even
`Class().staticmethodFunc()`
