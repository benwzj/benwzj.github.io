## About Random Number

Random number does NOT mean a different number every time. Random means something that can not be predicted logically.

### Pseudo Random and True Random.
Computers work on programs, and programs are definitive set of instructions. So it means there must be some algorithm to generate a random number as well.

Random numbers generated through a generation algorithm are called **pseudo random**. It can be predicted.

In order to generate a truly random number on our computers we need to get the random data from some outside source. This outside source is generally our keystrokes, mouse movements, data on network etc.

We do not need truly random numbers, unless it is related to security (e.g. encryption keys) or the basis of application is the randomness (e.g. Digital roulette wheels).

## How languages implement randomness

Most programming languages (like Python, Java, C++) implement pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs).
- PRNGs are algorithms that produce sequences of numbers that appear random, but are completely determined by an initial value called the **seed**.
- Once you set a seed, the sequence of random numbers is repeatable.

### Algorithm Behind PRNGs

| Algorithm                             | Used In                                       |
| ------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Linear Congruential Generator (LCG)   | C, early Java, Python (older versions)        |
| Mersenne Twister                      | Python `random`, NumPy (default before v1.17) |
| PCG (Permuted Congruential Generator) | `numpy.random.default_rng()`                  |
| Xoroshiro/Xoshiro                     | Modern C/C++ libraries and game engines       |

### Seed
Seed: Controlling the Sequence
Setting a seed ensures repeatability (useful for debugging, testing, reproducibility).
Without a seed, most languages auto-generate one using something like the current time or system entropy.

### State
A pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) doesn't truly generate random numbers, it produces a long, predictable sequence of numbers based on:
- A starting point (seed)
- An internal state that evolves as numbers are generated

So, the state is like a snapshot of the PRNG’s memory at a moment in time. If you save it, you can pause and resume the sequence exactly where you left off.

### True Randomness (TRNGs)

Most of time we only need PRNG, but some applications (e.g. cryptography) need true randomness:
Collected from physical sources like:
- Mouse movement
- Atmospheric noise
- Hardware random number generators

## Python Random module

Python Random module implements pseudo-random number generators for various distributions.
(Other Languea, Library will do smiliar things for Random)
- For **integers**, there is uniform selection from a range. 
- For **sequences**, there is uniform selection of a random element, a function to generate a random permutation of a list in-place, and a function for random sampling without replacement.
- Almost all module functions depend on the basic function `random()`, which generates a random float uniformly in the half-open range 0.0 <= X < 1.0. 
- Python uses the **Mersenne Twister** as the core generator.
- It produces 53-bit precision floats and has a period of 2**19937-1.
- It is completely unsuitable for cryptographic purposes.
- For security or cryptographic uses, see the secrets module.
- The functions supplied by this module are actually bound methods of a hidden instance of the `random.Random` class. You can instantiate your own instances of Random to get generators that don’t share state.

### Bookkeeping

#### `random.seed(a=None, version=2)`
Initialize the random number generator.
- If `a` is omitted or None, the current system time is used. 
- If `a` is an int, it is used directly.

#### `random.getstate()`
Return an object capturing the current internal state of the generator. This object can be passed to `setstate()` to restore the state.

#### `random.setstate(state)`
It can restore the state for the random generator.

### For Sequences random selection

#### random.choice(seq)
Return a random element from the non-empty sequence `seq`.

#### random.shuffle(x)
Shuffle the sequence `x` in place. (please note that, it will mutate the sequence). 
To shuffle an immutable sequence and return a new shuffled list, use `sample(x, k=len(x))` instead.

#### random.sample(population, k, *, counts=None)
Return a `k` length, new list of unique elements chosen from the `population` sequence or set. Used for random sampling without replacement.


## NumPy Random module

Python built-in random module vs. numpy.random

| Feature              | `random` (Python built-in)            | `numpy.random` (NumPy)                                  |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Library**          | Built-in (`import random`)            | Requires NumPy (`import numpy as np`)                   |
| **Speed**            | Slower                                | Much faster (optimized with C under the hood)           |
| **Data Types**       | Works with basic types (int, float)   | Works with NumPy arrays                                 |
| **Best For**         | Simple randomness (games, small apps) | Scientific computing, machine learning                  |
| **Random Arrays**    | Not supported                         | Easily generates arrays of random numbers               |
| **Distributions**    | Basic (uniform, normal)               | Extensive (normal, binomial, Poisson, etc.)             |
| **Seeding**          | `random.seed()`                       | `np.random.seed()` or `np.random.default_rng()`         |
| **Modern Interface** | Basic only                            | `np.random.default_rng()` (recommended in NumPy ≥ 1.17) |


Python random:
```py
import random
random.seed(0)
print(random.randint(1, 10))  # Random int between 1 and 10
```

NumPy random:
```py
import numpy as np
rng = np.random.default_rng(0)
print(rng.integers(1, 11))    # Same, but faster and better control
```
