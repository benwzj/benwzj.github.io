## Exponent

| Expression   | Meaning                         | Result | Explanation                             |
| ----------   | ------------------------------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| $$2^3$$      | $$2 \times 2 \times 2$$         | 8      | Multiply 2 three times                  |
| $$5^2$$      | $$5 \times 5$$                  | 25     | Square of 5                             |
| $$10^0$$     | —                               | 1      | Any non-zero number to the 0 power is 1 |
| $$2^{-3}$$   | $$\frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{8}$$ | 0.125  | Negative = reciprocal                   |
| $$4^{-1}$$   | $$\frac{1}{4}$$                 | 0.25   | Negative exponent = 1 over base         |
| $$9^{1/2}$$  | $$\sqrt{9}$$                    | 3      | Fractional = root                       |
| $$27^{1/3}$$ | $$\sqrt[3]{27}$$                | 3      | Cube root                               |
| $$16^{3/4}$$ | $$\left(\sqrt[4]{16}\right)^3$$ | 8      | Root first, then power                  |

### Negative Exponents
Represents the **reciprocal** (1 divided by the base raised to a positive power) For example:
$$2^{-3}$$  = 0.125

### Fractional Exponents
Represents **roots**. For example Cube root: 
$$\sqrt[3]{27}$$ = 3

## Logarithm

A logarithm is the inverse of an exponent.

$$\log_b(y) = x \quad \text{means} \quad b^x = y$$

- `b` = base
- `x` = exponent
- `y` = result

For Example: 

$$\log_2(8) = 3 \quad \text{because} \quad 2^3 = 8$$

### Common Logarithm Types

| Notation              | Name                  | Base      |
| --------------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| `log`                 | Common logarithm      | 10        |
| `ln`                  | Natural logarithm     | e ≈ 2.718 |
| `log₂`, `log₁₀`, etc. | Custom base logarithm | any base  |

### root vs logarithm

- A root asks: “What number, when raised to a certain power (like 2 or 3), gives this result?”
- A logarithm asks: “To what power must I raise a base to get this number?”

| Concept          | Root (√)                         | Logarithm (log)                        |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Question it asks | What number to raise to **n**?   | What **power** gives this number?      |
| Example          | $$\sqrt{16} = 4 → 4^2 = 16$$     | $$\log_2(16) = 4 → 2^4 = 16$$          |
| Fixed part       | The **power** (e.g., square = 2) | The **base** (e.g., base 2 or base 10) |
| Output           | The **number** itself            | The **exponent**                       |

- A root finds the **base**, given the result and the power
- A logarithm finds the **exponent**, given the base and the result

## Logistic function

There's a family of functions called logistic functions whose output represents a probability, always outputting a value between 0 and 1. 
The standard logistic function, also known as the sigmoid function (sigmoid means "s-shaped"), has the formula: 

$$f(x) = \frac{1}{1 + e^{-x}}$$

- The 'e' is Euler’s number, a fundamental mathematical constant. `e≈2.71828...`
- Logistic functions is one of The most important exponential function.

Here are the classic corresponding graph of the sigmoid function:

- As the input, x, increases, the output of the sigmoid function approaches but never reaches 1. 
- Similarly, as the input decreases, the sigmoid function's output approaches but never reaches 0.
- The sigmoid function will bend the linear equation straight line into an s-shape.


## Quantile
What Is a Quantile?
A quantile is a statistical term that refers to dividing a dataset into equal-sized intervals based on the values in the data. Quantiles help us understand the distribution of data and where values fall in relation to the whole set.

✅ Basic Idea
Quantiles split data into parts of equal probability. For example:
- If you divide data into 4 parts, you get quartiles
- If you divide it into 100 parts, you get percentiles
- If you divide it into 10 parts, you get deciles
