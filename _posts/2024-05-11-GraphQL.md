## GraphQL Concept

GraphQL is a query **language** for your API, and a server-side runtime for executing queries using a type system you define for your data. 

Clients form requests by using the GraphQL query language, and the GraphQL server executes the request and returns the data in a response. 

### Features

- **The GraphQL query language**: basically about **selecting fields** on objects.
- **A GraphQL service**: it is created by defining **types** and **fields on those types**, then providing functions for each field on each type.
- In **a GraphQL operation**: the client specifies how to structure the data when it is returned by the server. This makes it possible for the client to query only for the data it needs, in the format that it needs it in.
- **GraphQL request structures** resemble JSON. However, GraphQL requests don't use quotes for field names and don't have colons separating field names and values. Responses are in JSON format.

### GraphQL vs REST

We usually compare GraphQL and REST.

REST uses **"resources"** as its core concept. That means entities are identified by URIs.
In contrast, GraphQL's conceptual model is an entity **graph**. A GraphQL server operates on a single URL/endpoint, usually /graphql, and all GraphQL requests for a given service should be directed at this endpoint.

In a system like REST, you can only pass a single set of arguments - the query parameters and URL segments in your request.
But in GraphQL, every field and nested object can get its own set of arguments, making GraphQL a complete replacement for making multiple API fetches.

### GraphQL has three top-level operations:
1. Query - read-only fetch
2. Mutation - write, followed by a fetch
3. Subscription - long-lived connection for receiving data

GraphQL exposes these operations via a schema that defines the capabilities of an API. 
A schema is comprised of types, which can be root types (query, mutation, or subscription) or user-defined types.

## Basic example

1. A GraphQL service define object types:
```
type Query {
  me: User
}
type User {
  id: ID
  name: String
}
```
Along with functions for each field on each type:
```js
function Query_me(request) {
  return request.auth.user
}
function User_name(user) {
  return user.getName()
}
```

2. After a GraphQL service is running, it can receive GraphQL queries to and execute. 
For example, the query:
```
{
  me {
    name
  }
}
```
Could produce the following JSON result:
```json
{
  "me":{
    "name": "Luke Skywalker"
  }
}
```

## Basic Concepts

- **Arguments**: (just like arguments in Function()) 
In a system like REST, you can only pass a single set of arguments - the query parameters and URL segments in your request. In GraphQL, every field and nested object can get its own set of arguments. It let you fetch more specific data.
- **Aliases**: They let you rename the result of a field to anything you want.
- **fragments**: (just like Functions)
GraphQL includes reusable units called fragments. Fragments let you construct sets of fields, and then include them in queries where you need to.
- The **Operation Type** is either query, mutation, or subscription and describes what type of operation youâ€™re intending to do. 
- The **Operation Name** is a meaningful and explicit name for your operation.
- **Variables**: (`$variableName: variableType`)
All declared variables must be either scalars, enums, or input object types.
- Directives:
The core GraphQL specification includes exactly two directives, which must be supported by any spec-compliant GraphQL server implementation:
  - `@include(if: Boolean)` Only include this field in the result if the argument is `true`.
  - `@skip(if: Boolean)` Skip this field if the argument is `true`.

## GraphQL schema language

The most basic components of a GraphQL schema are object types, which just represent a kind of object you can fetch from your service, and what fields it has. 

### The Query and Mutation types

Most types in your schema will just be normal object types, but there are two types that are special within a schema:
```
schema {
  query: Query
  mutation: Mutation
}
```

### Scalar types: 
they represent the leaves of the query.

### Interface type:
An Interface is an abstract type that includes a certain set of fields that a type must include to implement the interface. (Like class)

### Union types:
Union types are very similar to interfaces, but they don't get to specify any common fields between the types.
`union SearchResult = Human | Droid | Starship`
Wherever we return a SearchResult type in our schema, we might get a Human, a Droid, or a Starship.

### Input types:
in the GraphQL schema language, input types look exactly the same as regular object types, but with the keyword input instead of type:
```
input ReviewInput {
  stars: Int!
  commentary: String
}
```
Input type is particularly valuable in the case of mutations, where you might want to pass in a whole object to be created. 
You can't mix input and output types in your schema. Input object types also can't have arguments on their fields.
