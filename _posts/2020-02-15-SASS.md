Sass is a CSS preproccessor that can make writing CSS faster and more efficient.

## What is a CSS preprocessor

A preprocessor is a program that takes a bit of code and compiles it into a different bit of code. In the case of CSS preprocessors, we're compiling the Sass language into regular old CSS that the browser can interpret. Therefore, the code you use on your HTML page will be the same as with CSS; all the compiling will go on behind the scenes.

## LESS vs. Sass

LESS and Sass are both CSS preprocessors, that do the same thing with the same end goal. LESS runs on Node.js, and Sass runs on Ruby. Compare CSS PREprocessors is a very good source of information about the actual differences between the two, and a third option known as Stylus.

LESS and Sass are more similar than they are different. However, Sass is more popular, and more widely used across a number of projects and frameworks. Big names are turning to Sass - for example, Bootstrap is switching from LESS to Sass for their next big release. It is useful to know and understand how to set up both.

## Sass vs. SCSS

Within Sass, there are two different preprocessors:

- Sass - Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets: .sass extension
- SCSS - Sassy CSS: .scss extension

SCSS is more widely used, and much easier to get started with and integrate with existing projects. In fact, if you take any .css file and save it as a .scss file, it is now a valid SCSS file.

SCSS uses all the syntax we're familiar with in CSS: semi-colons and curly brackets.
```
p {
  font-size: 1em;
}
```
Sass does away with the syntax, and relies on forced indentation.

```
p
  font-size: 1em
```

SCSS is the vastly more popular choice.

## Some SASS concepts

The Sass Guide on their official documentation is a fantastic getting started guide to understanding what Sass can do. Here are some of important terms.

- Variable - A variable is a storage container for a CSS value, such as a color or number. The syntax is written as $variable. You can use this code throughout the stylesheet after you have defined it.
- Nesting - Nesting reduces repetition in code and makes writing CSS faster and easier.
- Partials - Partials are SCSS files that begin with an underscore (_partial.scss) and are not compiled into their own CSS files, but are rather imported into a main file.
- Import - Use @import to compile all your partials into one file.
- Mixins - Use @mixin for  CSS, such as when vendor prefixes are required.
- Extend - Use @extend to change a few key aspects of otherwise identical elements - such as a group of buttons with different colors.
- Operators - Operators allow you to use math calculations in your CSS - such as defining the width of various parts of a layout.

## What is .css.map file

It is a **JSON format** file that links the CSS file to its source files. Normally, source files written in preprocessors (i.e., Less, Sass, Stylus, etc.). 
`.map` file is used for live debug to the source files from the web browser.

For preprocessors that support CSS source maps, DevTools lets you live-edit your preprocessor source files in the Sources panel, and view the results without having to leave DevTools or refresh the page. When you inspect an element whose styles are provided by a generated CSS file, the Elements panel displays a link to the original source file, not the generated .css file.

## Sass project

One of the great things about Sass is being able to organize your project. Instead of having one huge CSS file that becomes hard to maintain, you can compartmentalize all the components of your site into multiple files known as partials, and compile them into one, minified CSS file. Any change made to these partials will be detected, and the main file will be updated.
